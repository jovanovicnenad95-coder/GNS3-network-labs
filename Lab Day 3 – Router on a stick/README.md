I built a small L2 lab with two Cisco switches (trunk between them) and a router-on-a-stick for inter-VLAN routing. I created VLANs (10/20/30), assigned access ports for hosts on both switches, and set up subinterfaces on the router as gateways. I hit an issue where the trunk wouldn’t come up — turned out 802.1Q encapsulation isn’t the default, so I had to explicitly set dot1Q on the trunk interface. After that, the trunk formed correctly and VLAN traffic passed end-to-end. I verified by checking VLAN/trunk status and successfully pinging both within each VLAN and across VLANs via the router.
