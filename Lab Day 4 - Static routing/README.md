I built a three-router lab with separate LANs and used static routes to enable end-to-end connectivity. I could reach the remote LAN (10.3.3.0/24) via R2, but the loopback on R2 wasnâ€™t reachable at first. The issue was my static route targeted 172.16.2.0/32 instead of the actual loopback host 172.16.2.1/32. After fixing the destination to the exact /32 (and confirming return routing), pings to the loopback and between LANs succeeded.
